## 1. Instance vs Class

Think of a *class* as a blueprint for creating objects.
For example, a `Car` class is a blueprint, and each individual car (e.g., `myCar`, `yourCar`) is an instance of that class.

- **Class:** The blueprint or template. (e.g., `Car`)
- **Instance:** A specific object created from the class. (e.g., `new Car()`)
  <br/><br/>
⭐️ *In JavaScript terms, it’s similar to how you’d create objects using a constructor or factory function:*
      
  ```javascript
  class Car {
      constructor(make, model) {
      this.make = make;  // Instance property
      this.model = model; // Instance property
      }

      drive() {  // Instance method
      console.log(`${this.make} ${this.model} is driving`);
  };
    
  const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla"); // Instance
  myCar.drive(); // "Toyota Corolla is driving"
  ```
    
## 2. Static Methods/Variables Belong to the Class
Now, if something is static, it’s shared across all instances of the class. It’s like a universal property or method that doesn’t depend on any particular object.

- **Static:** Shared and doesn’t belong to a single instance.
- **Instance:** Belongs to a specific object and can vary for each one.
-   <br/><br/>
In Java, you can use static to define something at the class level, meaning all instances of the class share it or can access it. You don’t need to create an instance of the class to use static methods or variables.
```java
class Car {
    static int numberOfWheels = 4; // This belongs to the Car class itself
    String make; // This belongs to an instance

    Car(String make) {
        this.make = make; // Instance-specific data
    }

    static void showNumberOfWheels() {
        System.out.println("All cars have " + numberOfWheels + " wheels.");
    }

    void displayMake() {
        System.out.println("This car is a " + make);
    }
}
```
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car.showNumberOfWheels(); // Static: No need to create a car first
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota");
        myCar.displayMake(); // Instance: Specific to myCar
    }
}
// All cars have 4 wheels.
// This car is a Toyota.

```

## Key Analogy
Let’s think of a class as a blueprint for building a house:

### 1. Class-Level (Static):
- Imagine every house built from this blueprint has 4 walls by default.
The "4 walls" property belongs to the blueprint, not any specific house.
- In Java: This is the static property or method.

### 2. Instance-Level:
- The color of the paint or the furniture in each house can be different.
This belongs to the individual house (instance).
- In Java: These are the instance variables or methods.
